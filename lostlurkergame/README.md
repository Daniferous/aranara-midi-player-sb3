# Aranara MIDI Players
*Scratch-Based MIDI Player that is named Aranara because of my interest in Genshin Impact. This has nothing to do with programs that play MIDIs in any Genshin Impact instruments!*

**Please consider checking [rules and guidelines](https://daniferous.github.io/aranara-midi-player-sb3/guidelines) before reading below!**

# Lurker of the Lost
*Finally, it has been a while, but my experiment is ready for public testing... I hope?*

Out of all the things to make a horror game from, why a MIDI Player?
Well, that's the thing. This was not meant to happen. Aranara MIDI Player was supposed to be a normal build. But somehow, something bad happened. Perhaps you downloaded a MIDI file that should not be downloaded, or the version you retrieved is not from the official [Daniferous Discord Server](https://discord.gg/kTD8y6YDjJ), or that you just got very unlucky.

Either way, something is wrong with this version, and it is up to you to figure out what had happened.

## Notes and Limitations: 
1. This game is mostly unfinished and may contain bugs that I might have not caught.
2. Progress is only saved in a session. __If you refresh or close the tab, your progress will be lost.__
3. Progress can be retrieved only by dying. This... seems wrong and I might try to fix this soon.
4. So far, the last ending of this game is still under development and needs volunteers to help out with the end.

## Q&A
### 1. Does this program actually use MIDI files?
Somehow, yeah it does!
### 2. Why did you make this?
Eh, because why not?
### 3. I cannot open the link, it crashes my device!
Not a question, but I get this concern a lot. I might release a version with lesser audio samples as it seems to be the culprit of out-of-memory crashes.
### 4. Uhhh... I have a phone...
Also not a question, but this version does NOT support mobile devices at the moment. 
### 5. What if I have a MAC?
You could still play this game. Even Linux users could too! It is the MIDI Import program tool that can only be run on Windows. (Anyone willing to help me make a converter in python or java? hmu)
### 6. When will you finish this game?
I... I don't know, really. I am too busy and am behind on a lot of work. In short: we'll see. Definitely within this generation for sure.
