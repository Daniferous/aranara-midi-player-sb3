# Aranara MIDI Players
*Scratch-Based MIDI Player that is named Aranara because of my interest in Genshin Impact. This has nothing to do with programs that play MIDIs in any Genshin Impact instruments!*

# Rules and Guidelines
*Updated 2023.08.14*

## 1. Credits
Provide proper creditation for using any of my (Danify/Eden/OJG101) MIDI Players. Credits can be as concise as mentioning my [Scratch Profile](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/OjasnGamer101/) and/or my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Edenathan256). However, consider including the asset credits provided in the [original Scratch project link](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/554156777/) as assets, such as sounds, were created by other people.

## 2. Modification
Anyone is encouraged to make modifications to any of my MIDI players and any of its assets given that the intention is for educational and recreational purposes. **Any and all modifications shall include proper creditation as stated in the first rule.**

## 3. Usage
Anyone can use any of my MIDI players and any of its assets for educational and recreational purposes. That being said, profiting from my MIDI Players, or modified variations of my MIDI Players are not allowed. **Should anyone make a video containing any of my MIDI Players or any modification thereof shall provide proper creditation as stated in the first rule.**

## 4. MIDI/Song Import Policies
### 4.1 Regarding Private Leaked Content
Anyone can import any of their songs in AraMIDI format and publish their modification of any of my MIDI Players provided that the song is legally obtained and does not constitute as a "leak of private files". **Using any of my MIDI Players to host leaked content is not allowed.**
### 4.2 Regarding Harmful Content
Importing a MIDI/Song file with a name that violates Github TOS and Scratch TOS is not allowed. Any MIDI/Song file containing hate messages, harassment, discrimination, and profanity are not allowed to be imported to a published modification of any of my MIDI Players. **Using any of my MIDI Players to promote hate, harassment, discrimination, or any other illicit intent is not allowed.**

### By using any of my MIDI Players, you agree to these rules and guidelines.
While I may not be able to moderate content anyone has made, I have no responsibility for anyone's actions. Should your Scratch account get taken down for violating policies, you are only to blame. __Follow rules, and stay safe.__
