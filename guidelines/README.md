# Aranara MIDI Players
*Scratch-Based MIDI Player that is named Aranara because of my interest in Genshin Impact. This has nothing to do with programs that play MIDIs in any Genshin Impact instruments!*

# Rules and Guidelines
Most of the rules listed are common sense.
*Updated 2025.07.20*

## Summary of Rules and Guidelines:
1. Provide proper credits.
2. Modifications are allowed for non-commercial use.
3. Usage is limited to non-commercial use.
4. Importing of either leaked MIDI files or harmful MIDI files is not allowed.
5. Development Builds are invite-only.
6. Show respect and courtesy in any discussions in either my email, my [Scratch Profile](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/OjasnGamer101/), and the [Daniferousity Discord Server](https://discord.gg/kTD8y6YDjJ). 

## 1. Credits
Provide proper creditation for using any of my (daniferous/Eden/OJG101) MIDI Players. Credits can be as concise as mentioning my [Scratch Profile](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/OjasnGamer101/) and/or my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/DanieZuha). 
### 1.1 Regarding Asset Credits
However, please consider including the asset credits provided in the [original Scratch project link](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/554156777/) as assets, such as sounds, were created by other people. If you use assets found in any of my MIDI Players that are made by other people, credit those people in your modifications and/or projects.

## 2. Modification
Anyone is encouraged to make modifications to any of my MIDI players and any of its assets given that the intention is for educational and recreational purposes. **Any and all modifications shall include proper creditation as stated in the first rule.**

### 2.1 Regarding Project Assets
Anyone can adopt any of my MIDI Players and its project assets to their own creations provided that it follows the first and third rules. __Paywalls are not allowed in any modification or project containing any of my project assets.__

>The "Celestial MIDI Renderer" parody project is an example of such modification. Although it may contain "paywalled" assets, it does not *actually* require purchases. It does not even have a "checkout" page. The [README.md](https://daniferous.github.io/CelestialMIDIRender/meta/) for *that* project should tell more information. (If the link above does not exist, it has not been published yet.)

## 3. Usage
Anyone can use any of my MIDI players and any of its project assets for educational and recreational purposes. That being said, profiting from my MIDI Players, or modified variations of my MIDI Players are not allowed.
### 3.1 Regarding definitions of "profiting"
**Profiting refers to commercial use and is not allowed.** However, the only exception is on Video Showcases. Donations will be considered as profiting and therefore not allowed should said donation unlock features in modified variations of my MIDI Players.
### 3.2 Regarding Video Showcases of MIDI Players and MIDI Player-based Games
Profiting from video showcases in streaming services such as "YouTube" or "Tiktok" (monetization) is allowed. **Should anyone make a video containing any of my MIDI Players or any modification thereof shall provide proper creditation as stated in the first rule.**

## 4. MIDI/Song Import Policies
### 4.1 Regarding Private Leaked Content
Anyone can import any of their songs in AraMIDI format and publish their modification of any of my MIDI Players provided that the song is legally obtained and does not constitute as a "leak of private files". **Using any of my MIDI Players to host leaked content is not allowed.**
### 4.2 Regarding Harmful Content
Importing a MIDI/Song file with a name that violates Github TOS and Scratch TOS is not allowed. Any MIDI/Song file containing hate messages, harassment, discrimination, and profanity are not allowed to be imported to a published modification of any of my MIDI Players. **Using any of my MIDI Players to promote hate, harassment, discrimination, or any other illicit intent is not allowed.**

## 5. Insider/Private Builds
For those granted access to insider/private development builds, leaking and distribution of project files and assets are not allowed. **In violating this rule, you revoke your privilege to access Insider/Private Builds permanently.**
### 5.1 Regarding Access
**Access is invite-only.** Begging for access will not make it easier to gain access. Do not harass me or anyone who has access to Insider/Private Builds.

## 6. Safety and Conduct Policies
**Rules on discourse and interaction from [Daniferousity Discord Server](https://discord.gg/kTD8y6YDjJ) shall apply here.**
### 6.1 Respect Others

### 6.5 No Alternate Accounts
Usage of alternate accounts to try and gain access to Insider/Private Builds or to harass either me or anyone else is not allowed.

# By using any of my MIDI Players, you agree to these rules and guidelines.
While I may not be able to moderate content anyone has made, I have no responsibility for anyone's actions. Should your Scratch account get taken down for violating policies, you are only to blame. **Follow rules and stay safe.**
