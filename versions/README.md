# Aranara and Faelei MIDI Software Version History



## Faelei MIDI Render Toolkit Versions

### 1.6.6

*Added Fast Visual Generation Option. Uses a slightly altered visual generation algorithm that greatly reduces generation times, especially on MIDIs with high polyphonic quantities or MIDIs with "Sustain/Polyphony Bombs", at the cost of compromising visual quality on some MIDIs. Does not affect Audio Quality.*

> This version utilises a different MIDI Format (.faelei). To convert MIDIs to .faelei files, navigate to the [Faelei Branch of the Modded MIDIParser Tool here](https://github.com/Daniferous/MidiParser/tree/Faelei).

> [Faelei MIDI Render Toolkit 1.6.6](https://daniferous.github.io/aranara-midi-player-sb3/faelei/Faelei%20MIDI%20Render%20Toolkit%201.6.6.html)

---
### 1.6.5 

*Minor fixes applied to both FMRT and FMP.*

---
### 1.6.4

*Fixed Visual Bug that has persisted since early AMP versions.*

---
### 1.6.3

*Replaces the option to "limit audible note lengths to a maximum of 1 beat" from AMRT 1.5 to instead the option to enable Fast Audio Mode which makes the audio player nearly immune to Polyphony Spikes or "Polyphony Nukes."*

*Since this implemented a change made in AMRT 1.6, the name for this version has been changed from AMRT 1.5 Faelei MIDI MOD Rev 3 to FMRT 1.6.3.*

---

### 1.6.2
*Added an option to "limit audible note lengths to a maximum of 1 beat", which was originally in AMRT 1.5.*

*Used to be known as AMRT 1.5 Faelei MIDI MOD Rev 2.*

---

### 1.6.1
*Fork of Aranara MIDI Render Toolkit Version 1.6. May not work on all browsers but might occasionally work.*

*Initial Release of the Faelei MIDI Render Toolkit. Version numbering retained from the original Aranara MIDI Render Toolkit.*

*Originally named "AMRT 1.5 Faelei MIDI MOD Rev 1".*

## Aranara MIDI Render Toolkit Versions


### 1.6
*Fork of AMP 2.3.8. Contains advanced features, such as selective audio channel rendering and customizable color palettes. Added a setting to limit maximum audible note lengths to 1 bar. Works effectively for "normal" tempo MIDIs (or MIDIs that have tempos typically within 60~200.) The resolution setting now only impacts the visuals and not the audio.*

> Important: Please do not attempt to upload MIDIs with the Faelei format to any Aranara MIDI Softwares due to unsupported data. Only run Aranara MIDIs with Aranara MIDI Softwares.

---

### 1.5
*Added option to limit audible note lengths to a maximum of 1 beat.*


---

### 1.4
*Fixed Palette Bug persisting in versions prior. This does not affect the AMP series.*

## Faelei MIDI Player Versions

### 1.0.3

*Added Fast Visual Generation Option. Uses a slightly altered visual generation algorithm that greatly reduces generation times, especially on MIDIs with high polyphonic quantities or MIDIs with "Sustain/Polyphony Bombs", at the cost of compromising visual quality on some MIDIs. Does not affect Audio Quality.*

*This Fast Visual Generation Option is enabled by default and cannot be disabled. Please use the Faelei MIDI Render Toolkit to enable/disable this option.*

> This version utilises a different MIDI Format (.faelei). To convert MIDIs to .faelei files, navigate to the [Faelei Branch of the Modded MIDIParser Tool here](https://github.com/Daniferous/MidiParser/tree/Faelei).

### 1.0.2
*Minor fixes applied to both FMRT and FMP.*

*Has the Fast Audio Mode Setting from FMRT 1.6.4 enabled by default and cannot be disabled. Please use the Faelei MIDI Render Toolkit to enable/disable this option.*

---

### 1.0.1
*Minor fixes.*
*Fixed Visual Bug that has persisted since early AMP versions.*


---

### 1.0
*Fork of AMP 2.3.8. May not work on all browsers but might occasionally work.*

*Initial Release of the Faelei MIDI Player (Modded Aranara MIDI Player 2.3.8)*

## Aranara MIDI Player Versions 

### 2.3.8
*Added a setting to control audio velocity threshold. This mutes notes that are at or under this value.*

*Now uses the Fast Audio Mode by default. This reduces the impact of "Polyphony Spikes".*

> Important: Please do not attempt to upload MIDIs with the Faelei format to any Aranara MIDI Softwares due to unsupported data. Only run Aranara MIDIs with Aranara MIDI Softwares.

Aranara MIDI Format has been updated to Version 1.2.


---

### 2.3.2
*Added PFA Color Mode*
*Fixed a bug in deleting songs*

## Versions
### 1.1
```
+ Converted PPQ/TPQ is now identical to the imported MIDI PPQ if the PPQ value is at or below 1536.
+ Converted PPQ will undergo repeated division by 2 until it is at or below 1536.
```


---

### 1.0 (AranaraMIDI 1.2 Modded)
```
+ Added Header "[Faelei]█"
+ Adaptive PPQ/TPQ. Converted Faelei MIDIs may either have 768, 960, or 1024 PPQ depending on the original MIDI's PPQ. See PPQ rule (Faelei 1.0) below.
- Possible Support for Aranara MIDIs in some Faelei MIDI Players. Since Faelei MIDI is an extension to Aranara MIDIs, it is possible to run Aranara MIDIs.
```

## Faelei MIDI PPQ Rules - Version 1.1

### 1. All Converted MIDIs will retain their PPQ.
- This allows MIDIs with unusual/low PPQ values to be retained. For example, a MIDI with a resolution of 96 PPQ will no longer be converted to a 768 PPQ Faelei MIDI, reducing the converted Faelei MIDI file size by a small amount.
- This does not apply to MIDIs with large PPQs (see below).


---

### 2. For MIDIs with PPQ values greater than 1536, it will be brought down to a value at or under 1536.
- This is done by dividing the PPQ value by 2 multiple times until it is at or under 1536. For example, a MIDI with an original PPQ value of either 1920 or 3840 will be brought down to 960.
- In the updated Modded Faelei MIDI Parser, the following is the algorithm used to determine the PPQ/TPQ value used in the converted Faelei MIDI.

<div style="text-align: center;">

${\operatorname{ For }}\ \ O_{riginalTPQ}>1536:\ F_{aeleiTPQ}=\frac{O_{riginalTPQ}}{2^{\operatorname{ceil}\left(\log_{2}\left(\frac{O_{riginalTPQ}}{1536}\right)\right)}}$

${\operatorname{ For }}\ \ 1\le O_{riginalTPQ}\le1536:\ \ F_{aeleiTPQ}=O_{riginalTPQ}$

$Where:$

$O_{riginalTPQ}$ - The PPQ Value of the Imported MIDI

$F_{aeleiTPQ}$ - The PPQ Value of the Converted Faelei MIDI

</div>

- Thus, with a division factor of 2, <u>there is minimal loss in data accuracy compared to if it were a factor of 5 or 10</u>. However, issues may arise if a MIDI has a PPQ that is either odd-numbered or is not a multiple of 2<sup>n</sup>, with n being the number of divisions. This should not be an issue for MIDIs having common PPQ values.

- This new system is much simpler than the previous system since only a single logic is required (checking if the PPQ value is greater than 1536 to divide repeatedly) and allows most MIDIs to retain its resolution after conversion.

## Faelei MIDI PPQ Rules - Version 1.0

> Disclaimer: This has been superceded by a new MIDI PPQ System in Faelei 1.1.

### 1. All Converted MIDIs will have a PPQ of 768.
- This is a 2x increase in resolution compared to the Aranara MIDI format of 384 PPQ (Pulses per Quarter note) or 768 TPH (Ticks per Half-Note).
- There are exemptions listed below.


---

### 2. MIDIs with a PPQ divisible by 120 will have a PPQ of 960.
- This is to accomodate quintuplet notes/divisions.
- Most MIDIs are generally running on a resolution at this range, especially MIDIs made with FL Studio (PC).


---

### 3. MIDIs with a PPQ divisible by 128 but greater than 768 will have a PPQ of 1024.
- This only applies to MIDIs that either have a PPQ of 2048, 2560, 4096, etc.

> ### Disclaimer
> - It is worth noting that this system is imperfect. There may be new conditions, such as allowing any custom PPQ/resolutions to not conform to either of the rules provided that it falls within an "acceptable range."
> - The acceptable range will be between 512 and 1536. Larger PPQs will have to be rounded down.
